# Event Sourcing Explained üìö

## What is Event Sourcing? ü§î

Event Sourcing is a powerful architectural pattern that **stores all changes to application state as a sequence of events**. Instead of storing just the current state of data in your database, you store all the events that led to that state.

Think of it like a **bank statement** - instead of just showing your current balance, it shows every transaction that happened to get to that balance.

## The Problem with Traditional CRUD üò∞

Let's say you're building a banking system with traditional CRUD:

```sql
-- Traditional approach: Only current state
CREATE TABLE accounts (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    balance DECIMAL,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP
);

-- What we lose:
-- ‚ùå How did we get to this balance?
-- ‚ùå What transactions happened?
-- ‚ùå When did each change occur?
-- ‚ùå Who made the changes?
-- ‚ùå Can we recreate the state at any point in time?
```

**Example: Account with $900 balance**
- Current state: `$900`
- Questions we can't answer:
  - Was this account created with $900?
  - Did someone withdraw $100 from $1000?
  - Did someone deposit $400 to $500?
  - When did the last change happen?

## The Event Sourcing Solution ‚úÖ

Instead of storing state, we store **events** (facts about what happened):

```sql
-- Event sourcing approach: Store all events
CREATE TABLE events (
    event_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    aggregate_id UUID NOT NULL,
    event_type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    event_data JSONB NOT NULL,
    sequence_number BIGINT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Same account with event sourcing:**
```json
[
  {
    "eventType": "AccountCreated",
    "aggregateId": "acc-123",
    "data": { "initialBalance": 1000, "accountNumber": "12345" },
    "timestamp": "2023-01-15T10:00:00Z"
  },
  {
    "eventType": "MoneyWithdrawn", 
    "aggregateId": "acc-123",
    "data": { "amount": 100, "reason": "ATM Withdrawal", "location": "Main St" },
    "timestamp": "2023-01-15T14:30:00Z"
  }
]

// Current state: $900 (calculated from events)
// We know EVERYTHING that happened! üéâ
```

## Key Benefits of Event Sourcing üöÄ

### 1. **Complete Audit Trail** üìã
```
Traditional: "Balance is $900" 
Event Sourcing: "Account created with $1000, then $100 withdrawn at Main St ATM on Jan 15 at 2:30 PM"
```

### 2. **Time Travel** ‚è∞
```java
// What was the balance on January 1st?
Account account = eventStore.loadAggregateAtTime(accountId, "2023-01-01");
BigDecimal balance = account.getBalance(); // Easy!
```

### 3. **Natural Scalability** üìà
```
Events are immutable ‚Üí Easy to cache
Events are append-only ‚Üí Easy to replicate  
Events can be processed in parallel ‚Üí High performance
```

### 4. **Business Intelligence** üìä
```sql
-- Questions you can easily answer:
-- How much money was withdrawn from ATMs this month?
SELECT SUM(amount) FROM events 
WHERE event_type = 'MoneyWithdrawn' 
AND data->>'location' LIKE '%ATM%'
AND created_at >= '2023-01-01';

-- What are the most common transaction amounts?
-- Which accounts have the highest activity?
-- How do transaction patterns change over time?
```

### 5. **Flexibility for Future Requirements** üîÆ
```java
// New requirement: "Show all transactions over $500"
// Traditional: Needs database schema changes
// Event Sourcing: Just query existing events!

@EventHandler
public void handle(MoneyWithdrawnEvent event) {
    if (event.getAmount().compareTo(BigDecimal.valueOf(500)) > 0) {
        largeTransactionProjection.record(event);
    }
}
```

## How Event Sourcing Works üîß

### 1. **Commands** (What you want to do)
```java
public class WithdrawMoneyCommand {
    private UUID accountId;
    private BigDecimal amount;
    private String reason;
}
```

### 2. **Events** (What actually happened)
```java
@JsonTypeName("money.withdrawn")
public record MoneyWithdrawnEvent(
    UUID aggregateId,
    BigDecimal amount, 
    String reason,
    Instant timestamp
) implements Event {
    @Override
    public String getEventType() { return "money.withdrawn"; }
}
```

### 3. **Aggregates** (Business logic + current state)
```java
public class Account extends AggregateRoot {
    private BigDecimal balance;
    private String accountNumber;
    
    // Command handler
    public void withdraw(BigDecimal amount, String reason) {
        if (balance.compareTo(amount) < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Insufficient funds");
        }
        applyChange(new MoneyWithdrawnEvent(getId(), amount, reason, Instant.now()));
    }
    
    // Event handler  
    private void on(MoneyWithdrawnEvent event) {
        this.balance = this.balance.subtract(event.amount());
    }
}
```

### 4. **Event Store** (Persistence)
```java
// Save events
EventStream stream = eventStore.appendEvents(accountId, events, expectedVersion);

// Load events and reconstruct state
Account account = eventStore.loadAggregate(accountId, Account.class);
```

## The Firefly Event Sourcing Architecture üèóÔ∏è

### Why We Built It This Way

#### **1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Foundation**
```java
// Clear domain concepts
public class Account extends AggregateRoot {
    // Business rules are explicit
    public void withdraw(BigDecimal amount) {
        if (balance.compareTo(amount) < 0) {
            throw new InsufficientFundsException("Cannot withdraw " + amount);
        }
        applyChange(new MoneyWithdrawnEvent(getId(), amount));
    }
}
```

**Why?** Banking business rules are complex. DDD helps us model the real world accurately.

#### **2. Reactive Programming with R2DBC**
```java
// Non-blocking database operations
public Mono<EventStream> appendEvents(UUID aggregateId, List<Event> events) {
    return transactionalOperator.transactional(
        checkConcurrency(aggregateId, expectedVersion)
            .flatMap(currentVersion -> insertEvents(events))
            .map(result -> EventStream.of(aggregateId, events))
    );
}
```

**Why?** Banking systems need high throughput and low latency. Reactive programming handles thousands of concurrent operations efficiently.

#### **3. PostgreSQL with JSONB Optimization**
```sql
-- Efficient JSON querying
CREATE TABLE events (
    event_data JSONB NOT NULL,  -- Native JSON support
    ...
);

-- Fast queries on event data
SELECT * FROM events 
WHERE event_data->>'amount' > '1000'  -- Direct JSON querying
AND event_type = 'money.withdrawn';
```

**Why?** Events have flexible structure. JSONB gives us JSON flexibility with SQL performance.

#### **4. Optimistic Concurrency Control**
```java
public Mono<EventStream> appendEvents(UUID aggregateId, List<Event> events, 
                                    long expectedVersion) {
    return checkConcurrency(aggregateId, expectedVersion)  // Prevent conflicts
        .flatMap(currentVersion -> persistEvents(events));
}
```

**Why?** Multiple users might modify the same account simultaneously. Optimistic locking prevents conflicts without blocking.

#### **5. Comprehensive Monitoring**
```java
@Component 
public class EventStoreMetrics {
    private final Timer appendTimer = Timer.builder("eventstore.append.duration").register(registry);
    private final Counter eventsCounter = Counter.builder("eventstore.events.appended").register(registry);
    
    public void recordAppend(Duration duration, int eventCount) {
        appendTimer.record(duration);
        eventsCounter.increment(eventCount);
    }
}
```

**Why?** Production banking systems need observability. We built-in metrics, health checks, and monitoring.

## Common Patterns We Implemented üéØ

### **1. Aggregate Pattern**
- Encapsulates business logic
- Maintains consistency boundaries
- Generates events from commands

### **2. Repository Pattern** 
- `EventStore` abstracts persistence
- Clean separation of domain and infrastructure
- Easy to test and switch implementations

### **3. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**
- Commands modify state (write side)
- Queries read projections (read side)  
- Optimized for different access patterns

### **4. Transactional Outbox Pattern**
```sql
CREATE TABLE event_outbox (
    outbox_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    event_data JSONB NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'PENDING',
    ...
);
```
- Reliable event publishing
- Consistency between database and message bus
- Handles network failures gracefully

### **5. Snapshot Pattern**
```java
// For aggregates with many events
if (eventCount > snapshotThreshold) {
    Snapshot snapshot = createSnapshot(aggregate);
    snapshotStore.save(snapshot);
}
```
- Performance optimization
- Faster aggregate loading
- Configurable thresholds

## When to Use Event Sourcing ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### ‚úÖ **Great for:**
- **Audit Requirements**: Financial, medical, legal systems
- **Complex Business Logic**: Banking, trading, insurance
- **Analytics Heavy**: Need to answer "how did we get here?"
- **Temporal Queries**: "What was the state on X date?"
- **High Scalability**: Read-heavy systems with complex reporting

### ‚ùå **Consider Alternatives for:**
- **Simple CRUD**: Basic user profiles, settings
- **Low Audit Requirements**: Internal tools, caches
- **Small Teams**: Additional complexity might not be worth it
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Adds development overhead

## Real-World Banking Example üè¶

```java
// Traditional approach - we lose information
@Entity
public class Account {
    private BigDecimal balance; // Only current state
    // Lost: When? How? Who? Why?
}

// Event sourcing approach - complete story
public class Account extends AggregateRoot {
    private BigDecimal balance;
    
    public void withdraw(WithdrawMoneyCommand cmd) {
        // Business rule validation
        if (balance.compareTo(cmd.getAmount()) < 0) {
            throw new InsufficientFundsException();
        }
        
        // Record what happened
        applyChange(new MoneyWithdrawnEvent(
            getId(), 
            cmd.getAmount(), 
            cmd.getReason(),
            cmd.getAtmLocation(),
            cmd.getUserId(),
            Instant.now()
        ));
    }
    
    private void on(MoneyWithdrawnEvent event) {
        this.balance = this.balance.subtract(event.getAmount());
        // State is derived from events
    }
}
```

**Benefits in banking:**
- Complete transaction history for compliance
- Fraud detection through pattern analysis  
- Customer service can see exact transaction details
- Regulatory reporting is straightforward
- Can replay events to test new business rules
