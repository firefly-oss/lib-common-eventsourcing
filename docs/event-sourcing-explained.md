# Event Sourcing Explained üìö

> **üí° Want a complete working example?** Check out our [Account Ledger Tutorial](./tutorial-account-ledger.md) that demonstrates all these concepts with production-ready code.

## What is Event Sourcing? ü§î

Event Sourcing is a powerful architectural pattern that **stores all changes to application state as a sequence of events**. Instead of storing just the current state of data in your database, you store all the events that led to that state.

Think of it like an **Account Ledger** - instead of just showing your current balance, it shows every transaction (deposit, withdrawal, freeze, etc.) that happened to get to that balance.

## The Problem with Traditional CRUD üò∞

Let's say you're building a banking system with traditional CRUD:

```sql
-- Traditional approach: Only current state
CREATE TABLE accounts (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    balance DECIMAL,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP
);

-- What we lose:
-- ‚ùå How did we get to this balance?
-- ‚ùå What transactions happened?
-- ‚ùå When did each change occur?
-- ‚ùå Who made the changes?
-- ‚ùå Can we recreate the state at any point in time?
```

**Example: Account with $900 balance**
- Current state: `$900`
- Questions we can't answer:
  - Was this account created with $900?
  - Did someone withdraw $100 from $1000?
  - Did someone deposit $400 to $500?
  - When did the last change happen?

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Misconception: "Just add an aggregate table"**

```sql
-- ‚ùå WRONG: This is NOT event sourcing!
CREATE TABLE account_ledger (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    balance DECIMAL,
    status VARCHAR(20),
    frozen BOOLEAN
);
```

**Why this is wrong:**
- ‚ùå You're storing current state, not events
- ‚ùå You lose the complete history
- ‚ùå You can't time-travel or replay events
- ‚ùå This is just traditional CRUD with extra steps

**The correct approach:**
- ‚úÖ Store events in the `events` table
- ‚úÖ Aggregates live in memory only (no table!)
- ‚úÖ Create read models for queries (separate tables)

## The Event Sourcing Solution ‚úÖ

Instead of storing state, we store **events** (facts about what happened):

```sql
-- Event sourcing approach: Store all events
CREATE TABLE events (
    event_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    aggregate_id UUID NOT NULL,
    event_type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    event_data JSONB NOT NULL,
    sequence_number BIGINT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Same account with event sourcing (Account Ledger):**
```json
[
  {
    "eventType": "AccountOpened",
    "aggregateId": "acc-123",
    "data": {
      "accountNumber": "ACC-2025-001",
      "accountType": "CHECKING",
      "customerId": "cust-456",
      "initialDeposit": 1000,
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    "timestamp": "2023-01-15T10:00:00Z"
  },
  {
    "eventType": "MoneyWithdrawn",
    "aggregateId": "acc-123",
    "data": {
      "amount": 100,
      "destination": "ATM",
      "reference": "ATM-001",
      "withdrawnBy": "user-123"
    },
    "timestamp": "2023-01-15T14:30:00Z"
  }
]

// Current state: $900 (calculated from events)
// We know EVERYTHING that happened! üéâ
```

> **üìö See the [Account Ledger Tutorial](./tutorial-account-ledger.md)** for the complete implementation of this example.

## Key Benefits of Event Sourcing üöÄ

### 1. **Complete Audit Trail** üìã
```
Traditional: "Balance is $900" 
Event Sourcing: "Account created with $1000, then $100 withdrawn at Main St ATM on Jan 15 at 2:30 PM"
```

### 2. **Time Travel** ‚è∞
```java
// What was the balance on January 1st?
Account account = eventStore.loadAggregateAtTime(accountId, "2023-01-01");
BigDecimal balance = account.getBalance(); // Easy!
```

### 3. **Natural Scalability** üìà
```
Events are immutable ‚Üí Easy to cache
Events are append-only ‚Üí Easy to replicate  
Events can be processed in parallel ‚Üí High performance
```

### 4. **Business Intelligence** üìä
```sql
-- Questions you can easily answer:
-- How much money was withdrawn from ATMs this month?
SELECT SUM(amount) FROM events 
WHERE event_type = 'MoneyWithdrawn' 
AND data->>'location' LIKE '%ATM%'
AND created_at >= '2023-01-01';

-- What are the most common transaction amounts?
-- Which accounts have the highest activity?
-- How do transaction patterns change over time?
```

### 5. **Flexibility for Future Requirements** üîÆ
```java
// New requirement: "Show all transactions over $500"
// Traditional: Needs database schema changes
// Event Sourcing: Just query existing events!

@EventHandler
public void handle(MoneyWithdrawnEvent event) {
    if (event.getAmount().compareTo(BigDecimal.valueOf(500)) > 0) {
        largeTransactionProjection.record(event);
    }
}
```

## How Event Sourcing Works üîß

### 1. **Commands** (What you want to do)
```java
public class WithdrawMoneyCommand {
    private UUID accountId;
    private BigDecimal amount;
    private String reason;
}
```

### 2. **Events** (What actually happened)
```java
@JsonTypeName("money.withdrawn")
public record MoneyWithdrawnEvent(
    UUID aggregateId,
    BigDecimal amount, 
    String reason,
    Instant timestamp
) implements Event {
    @Override
    public String getEventType() { return "money.withdrawn"; }
}
```

### 3. **Aggregates** (Business logic + current state)
```java
public class Account extends AggregateRoot {
    private BigDecimal balance;
    private String accountNumber;
    
    // Command handler
    public void withdraw(BigDecimal amount, String reason) {
        if (balance.compareTo(amount) < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Insufficient funds");
        }
        applyChange(new MoneyWithdrawnEvent(getId(), amount, reason, Instant.now()));
    }
    
    // Event handler  
    private void on(MoneyWithdrawnEvent event) {
        this.balance = this.balance.subtract(event.amount());
    }
}
```

### 4. **Event Store** (Persistence)
```java
// Save events
EventStream stream = eventStore.appendEvents(accountId, events, expectedVersion);

// Load events and reconstruct state
Account account = eventStore.loadAggregate(accountId, Account.class);
```

## The Firefly Event Sourcing Architecture üèóÔ∏è

### Why We Built It This Way

#### **1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Foundation**
```java
// Clear domain concepts
public class Account extends AggregateRoot {
    // Business rules are explicit
    public void withdraw(BigDecimal amount) {
        if (balance.compareTo(amount) < 0) {
            throw new InsufficientFundsException("Cannot withdraw " + amount);
        }
        applyChange(new MoneyWithdrawnEvent(getId(), amount));
    }
}
```

**Why?** Banking business rules are complex. DDD helps us model the real world accurately.

#### **2. Reactive Programming with R2DBC**
```java
// Non-blocking database operations
public Mono<EventStream> appendEvents(UUID aggregateId, List<Event> events) {
    return transactionalOperator.transactional(
        checkConcurrency(aggregateId, expectedVersion)
            .flatMap(currentVersion -> insertEvents(events))
            .map(result -> EventStream.of(aggregateId, events))
    );
}
```

**Why?** Banking systems need high throughput and low latency. Reactive programming handles thousands of concurrent operations efficiently.

#### **3. PostgreSQL with JSONB Optimization**
```sql
-- Efficient JSON querying
CREATE TABLE events (
    event_data JSONB NOT NULL,  -- Native JSON support
    ...
);

-- Fast queries on event data
SELECT * FROM events 
WHERE event_data->>'amount' > '1000'  -- Direct JSON querying
AND event_type = 'money.withdrawn';
```

**Why?** Events have flexible structure. JSONB gives us JSON flexibility with SQL performance.

#### **4. Optimistic Concurrency Control**
```java
public Mono<EventStream> appendEvents(UUID aggregateId, List<Event> events, 
                                    long expectedVersion) {
    return checkConcurrency(aggregateId, expectedVersion)  // Prevent conflicts
        .flatMap(currentVersion -> persistEvents(events));
}
```

**Why?** Multiple users might modify the same account simultaneously. Optimistic locking prevents conflicts without blocking.

#### **5. Comprehensive Monitoring**
```java
@Component 
public class EventStoreMetrics {
    private final Timer appendTimer = Timer.builder("eventstore.append.duration").register(registry);
    private final Counter eventsCounter = Counter.builder("eventstore.events.appended").register(registry);
    
    public void recordAppend(Duration duration, int eventCount) {
        appendTimer.record(duration);
        eventsCounter.increment(eventCount);
    }
}
```

**Why?** Production banking systems need observability. We built-in metrics, health checks, and monitoring.

## üóÑÔ∏è **Database Tables in Event Sourcing: What Goes Where?**

This is the most critical concept to understand:

### **Tables You MUST Create:**

#### 1. **Events Table** (Source of Truth)
```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
    event_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    aggregate_id UUID NOT NULL,
    event_type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    event_data JSONB NOT NULL,
    version BIGINT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```
**Purpose:** Store all domain events (immutable history)

#### 2. **Snapshots Table** (Performance)
```sql
CREATE TABLE snapshots (
    aggregate_id UUID NOT NULL,
    aggregate_type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    aggregate_version BIGINT NOT NULL,
    snapshot_data JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```
**Purpose:** Cache aggregate state to avoid replaying millions of events

#### 3. **Read Model Tables** (Queries)
```sql
CREATE TABLE account_ledger_read_model (
    account_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    account_number VARCHAR(50),
    balance DECIMAL(19,4),
    currency VARCHAR(3),
    frozen BOOLEAN,
    closed BOOLEAN,
    status VARCHAR(20),
    last_updated TIMESTAMP
);
```
**Purpose:** Fast queries without event replay (traditional table!)

### **Tables You MUST NOT Create:**

#### ‚ùå **NO Aggregate Table**
```sql
-- ‚ùå WRONG: Do NOT create this!
CREATE TABLE account_ledger (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    balance DECIMAL,
    frozen BOOLEAN
);
```

**Why NOT?**
- Aggregates are **reconstructed from events** in memory
- Creating an aggregate table means you're doing CRUD, not event sourcing
- The aggregate's state is **derived**, not stored

### **Summary Table:**

| Component | Table? | Table Name | Mutable? | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|------------|----------|---------|
| Events | ‚úÖ YES | `events` | ‚ùå Append-only | Source of truth |
| Snapshots | ‚úÖ YES | `snapshots` | ‚ùå Append-only | Performance |
| Read Models | ‚úÖ YES | `*_read_model` | ‚úÖ Updated | Fast queries |
| Aggregates | ‚ùå **NO** | N/A | N/A | Business logic (in-memory) |

---

## Common Patterns We Implemented üéØ

### **1. Aggregate Pattern**
- Encapsulates business logic
- Maintains consistency boundaries
- Generates events from commands
- **Lives in memory only - NO TABLE!**

### **2. Repository Pattern** 
- `EventStore` abstracts persistence
- Clean separation of domain and infrastructure
- Easy to test and switch implementations

### **3. Read/Write Separation**
- Commands modify state (write side)
- Queries read projections (read side)  
- Optimized for different access patterns

### **4. Transactional Outbox Pattern**
```sql
CREATE TABLE event_outbox (
    outbox_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    event_data JSONB NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'PENDING',
    ...
);
```
- Reliable event publishing
- Consistency between database and message bus
- Handles network failures gracefully

### **5. Snapshot Pattern**
```java
// For aggregates with many events
if (eventCount > snapshotThreshold) {
    Snapshot snapshot = createSnapshot(aggregate);
    snapshotStore.save(snapshot);
}
```
- Performance optimization
- Faster aggregate loading
- Configurable thresholds

```

### ‚úÖ **Event Sourcing is Great For:**

| Use Case | Why Event Sourcing Wins | Example |
|----------|------------------------|---------|
| **Financial Systems** | Complete audit trail, regulatory compliance, fraud detection | Banking transactions, payment processing, trading platforms |
| **Complex Business Logic** | Clear separation of commands and events, testable business rules | Insurance claims, order fulfillment, inventory management |
| **Temporal Queries** | Time travel capabilities, state reconstruction at any point | "What was the account balance on Dec 31?" |
| **Analytics & BI** | Rich event history for pattern analysis and reporting | Customer behavior analysis, transaction patterns |
| **Debugging & Support** | Complete history of what happened and why | Customer service investigations, bug reproduction |
| **Event-Driven Architecture** | Natural fit for microservices and async processing | Distributed systems, event-driven microservices |

### ‚ùå **Traditional Tables are Better For:**

| Use Case | Why Traditional Wins | Example |
|----------|---------------------|---------|
| **Simple CRUD** | Less complexity, faster development | User profiles, application settings, reference data |
| **Low Audit Requirements** | No need for historical data | Cache tables, temporary data, session storage |
| **Rapid Prototyping** | Quick to implement and iterate | MVPs, proof of concepts, internal tools |
| **Small Teams** | Less infrastructure and learning curve | Startups with limited resources |
| **Mostly Static Data** | Infrequent updates, current state is sufficient | Product catalogs, configuration data |

### üéØ **Comparison Table: Event Sourcing vs Traditional**

| Aspect | Event Sourcing | Traditional Tables |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Data Storage** | All events (append-only) | Current state only |
| **Audit Trail** | ‚úÖ Complete, automatic | ‚ùå Requires separate audit tables |
| **Time Travel** | ‚úÖ Built-in | ‚ùå Not possible without versioning |
| **Complexity** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Higher (events + projections) | ‚úÖ Lower (simple CRUD) |
| **Performance** | ‚úÖ Fast writes (append-only)<br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Reads need projections | ‚úÖ Fast reads<br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Writes can be slow |
| **Scalability** | ‚úÖ Excellent (immutable events) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate (locking, updates) |
| **Debugging** | ‚úÖ Full history available | ‚ùå Lost information |
| **Analytics** | ‚úÖ Rich event data | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited to current state |
| **Learning Curve** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Steeper | ‚úÖ Familiar to most developers |
| **Storage Cost** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Higher (all events) | ‚úÖ Lower (current state) |

### üí° **Hybrid Approach: Best of Both Worlds**

You don't have to choose one or the other! Many successful systems use both:

```java
// Event Sourcing for critical business entities
public class BankAccount extends AggregateRoot {
    // Full event history for transactions
    public void withdraw(BigDecimal amount) {
        applyChange(new MoneyWithdrawnEvent(getId(), amount));
    }
}

// Traditional tables for supporting data
@Entity
public class UserProfile {
    // Simple CRUD for user preferences
    private String displayName;
    private String theme;
    private String language;
}
```

**When to use hybrid:**
- Core business logic ‚Üí Event Sourcing
- Supporting/reference data ‚Üí Traditional tables
- User preferences ‚Üí Traditional tables
- Critical transactions ‚Üí Event Sourcing

## Real-World Example: Account Ledger üè¶

```java
// Traditional approach - we lose information
@Entity
public class Account {
    private BigDecimal balance; // Only current state
    // Lost: When? How? Who? Why?
}

// Event sourcing approach - complete story (Account Ledger)
public class AccountLedger extends AggregateRoot {
    private BigDecimal balance;
    private boolean frozen;
    private boolean closed;

    public void withdraw(BigDecimal amount, String destination,
                        String reference, String withdrawnBy) {
        // Business rule validation
        validateAccountIsActive();
        if (balance.compareTo(amount) < 0) {
            throw new InsufficientFundsException(getId());
        }

        // Record what happened
        applyChange(new MoneyWithdrawnEvent(
            getId(),
            amount,
            destination,
            reference,
            withdrawnBy
        ));
    }

    @EventHandler
    public void apply(MoneyWithdrawnEvent event) {
        this.balance = this.balance.subtract(event.getAmount());
        // State is derived from events
    }

    private void validateAccountIsActive() {
        if (closed) throw new AccountClosedException(getId());
        if (frozen) throw new AccountFrozenException(getId());
    }
