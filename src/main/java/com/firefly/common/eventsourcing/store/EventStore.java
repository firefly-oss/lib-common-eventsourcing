/**
 * Main interface for event storage and retrieval in the event sourcing system.
 * <p>
 * The EventStore is the central component that provides:
 * - Persistence of domain events
 * - Retrieval of event streams for aggregate reconstruction
 * - Global event querying capabilities
 * - Optimistic concurrency control through versioning
 * - Event ordering guarantees
 * <p>
 * Implementations should ensure:
 * - ACID properties for event persistence
 * - Ordering within aggregate streams
 * - Optimistic concurrency control
 * - High performance for both reads and writes
 * - Scalability for large event volumes
 * <p>
 * The interface is designed to be reactive, using Project Reactor types
 * to support non-blocking operations and backpressure handling.
