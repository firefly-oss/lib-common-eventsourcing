/**
 * Exception thrown when optimistic concurrency control fails.
 * <p>
 * This exception occurs when trying to append events to an aggregate
 * with an expected version that doesn't match the current version
 * in the event store. This indicates that another process has
 * modified the aggregate between the time it was loaded and
 * the time the events are being appended.
 * <p>
 * Applications should handle this exception by:
 * 1. Reloading the aggregate from the event store
 * 2. Re-applying the business logic
 * 3. Attempting to save again
