/**
 * Base interface for all domain events in the event sourcing system.
 * <p>
 * Events represent facts that have happened in the past and are immutable.
 * They capture state changes in aggregates and form the single source of truth
 * for the system's state.
 * <p>
 * Events should be:
 * - Immutable (all fields final)
 * - Serializable (support JSON serialization)
 * - Self-contained (include all necessary information)
 * - Domain-focused (represent business concepts, not technical operations)
 * <p>
 * <b>Recommended Approach - Using @DomainEvent annotation:</b>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * @DomainEvent("account.created")
 * @SuperBuilder
 * @Getter
 * @NoArgsConstructor
 * @AllArgsConstructor
 * public class AccountCreatedEvent extends AbstractDomainEvent {
 *     private String accountNumber;
 *     private String accountType;
 *     private BigDecimal initialBalance;
 *     // No need to override getEventType() - it's read from the annotation!
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * <b>Alternative - Using Java Records:</b>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * @DomainEvent("account.created")
 * public record AccountCreatedEvent(
 *     UUID aggregateId,
 *     String accountNumber,
 *     String accountType,
 *     BigDecimal initialBalance
 * ) implements Event {
 *     // getEventType() is automatically provided by the default method
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @see DomainEvent
 * @see AbstractDomainEvent

     * <b>Default Implementation:</b>
     * The default implementation reads the event type from the {@link DomainEvent}
     * annotation. If the annotation is not present, it throws an exception.

     * You can override this method if you need custom logic, but using the
