/**
 * Interface representing a snapshot of aggregate state.
 * <p>
 * Snapshots are used to optimize aggregate reconstruction by capturing
 * the state at a specific point in time, reducing the number of events
 * that need to be replayed from the event store.
 * <p>
 * Snapshots contain:
 * - The complete aggregate state at a specific version
 * - Metadata about when and why the snapshot was taken
 * - Version information for consistency checking
 * <p>
 * Implementations should be:
 * - Serializable (support JSON/binary serialization)
 * - Immutable (state should not change after creation)
 * - Self-contained (include all necessary state information)
 * <p>
 * Example implementation:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * public record AccountSnapshot(
 *     UUID aggregateId,
 *     String accountNumber,
 *     BigDecimal balance,
 *     String accountType,
 *     long version,
 *     Instant createdAt
 * ) implements Snapshot {
 *     
 *     @Override
 *     public String getSnapshotType() {
 *         return "Account";
 *     }
 * }
 * }
