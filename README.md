## What is Event Sourcing?

### The Core Idea (Explained Simply)

Imagine you're tracking your bank account. There are two ways to do this:

**📝 Traditional Way (CRUD):**
You have a notebook with just one line: "Current Balance: $900"

**Problem:** If someone asks "How did you get $900?", you can't answer. The history is lost.

**📚 Event Sourcing Way:**
You have a ledger with every transaction:
```
Jan 15, 10:00 AM - Opened account with $1,000
Jan 15, 2:30 PM  - Withdrew $100 at ATM Main St
Current Balance: $900 (calculated from events)
```

**Benefit:** You can answer ANY question about your account's history!

### Technical Comparison

<table>
<tr>
<th>Traditional CRUD</th>
<th>Event Sourcing</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

**What you store:**
```sql
-- Just current state
UPDATE accounts
SET balance = 900
WHERE id = 'acc-123';
```

**❌ Lost Information:**
- How did it change?
- When did it change?
- Who made the change?
- Why was it changed?

**What you can answer:**
- "What is the current balance?" ✅

**What you CANNOT answer:**
- "What was the balance yesterday?" ❌
- "Who withdrew money last week?" ❌
- "How many deposits this month?" ❌

</td>
<td>

**What you store:**
```json
[
  {
    "type": "account.opened",
    "balance": 1000,
    "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
    "userId": "user-123"
  },
  {
    "type": "money.withdrawn",
    "amount": 100,
    "source": "ATM Main St",
    "timestamp": "2025-01-15T14:30:00Z",
    "userId": "user-123"
  }
]
```

**✅ Complete Information:**
- Full transaction history
- Who, what, when, where, why
- Time travel capabilities
- Regulatory compliance ready

**What you can answer:**
- "What is the current balance?" ✅
- "What was the balance yesterday?" ✅
- "Who withdrew money last week?" ✅
- "How many deposits this month?" ✅
- "Show me all ATM withdrawals" ✅

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Real-World Analogy

Think of Event Sourcing like **Git for your data**:

- **Git** doesn't just store your current code - it stores every commit (event)
- You can see the **full history** of changes
- You can **time travel** to any previous state
- You can **replay** changes to understand how you got to the current state
- You can **branch** and experiment without losing history

Event Sourcing does the same for your business data!

### When to Use Event Sourcing (Decision Guide)

Ask yourself these questions:

#### ✅ Use Event Sourcing if you answer YES to any of these:

1. **"Do I need to know WHAT happened, not just the current state?"**
   - Example: Banking - "Show me all transactions for this account"
   - Example: Healthcare - "What treatments did this patient receive?"

2. **"Do I need to know WHEN something happened?"**
   - Example: Legal - "What was the contract status on March 15th?"
   - Example: Compliance - "Prove this change happened before the deadline"

3. **"Do I need to know WHO made changes?"**
   - Example: Audit - "Who approved this transaction?"
   - Example: Security - "Who accessed this sensitive data?"

4. **"Do I need to know WHY something changed?"**
   - Example: Fraud detection - "Why was this account frozen?"
   - Example: Debugging - "What caused this balance discrepancy?"

5. **"Do I need to replay or undo changes?"**
   - Example: Testing - "Replay production events in test environment"
   - Example: Recovery - "Undo the last 10 transactions"

#### ❌ Don't Use Event Sourcing if:

1. **"I just need basic CRUD operations"**
   - Example: Simple contact list, basic settings
   - Better choice: Traditional database with timestamps

2. **"I don't care about history"**
   - Example: Current weather data, cache data
   - Better choice: Key-value store or simple tables

3. **"My team has no experience with event sourcing"**
   - Risk: Steep learning curve, potential mistakes
   - Better choice: Start with traditional approach, migrate later if needed

4. **"I need simple, fast queries on current state only"**
   - Example: "Show me all active users" (no history needed)
   - Better choice: Traditional database with indexes

### Real-World Use Cases

**✅ Banking (Perfect Fit):**
```
Question: "What was the account balance on December 31st for tax purposes?"
Event Sourcing: Replay all events up to Dec 31 → Exact balance ✅
Traditional DB: "We only have current balance" ❌
```

**✅ E-commerce (Perfect Fit):**
```
Question: "This customer claims they never received a refund. Prove it."
Event Sourcing: Show RefundProcessedEvent with timestamp, amount, method ✅
Traditional DB: "Order status shows 'Refunded' but no details" ❌
```

**❌ Simple Blog (Not a Good Fit):**
```
Question: "Show me all published blog posts"
Event Sourcing: Replay all PostCreated, PostPublished events → Overkill ❌
Traditional DB: SELECT * FROM posts WHERE status='published' → Simple ✅
```

## Core Concepts (Learning Path)

### 🎓 Understanding the Building Blocks

Event Sourcing has 4 main components. Let's understand each one step by step:

#### 1️⃣ Events - "What Happened"

**Simple Explanation:**
Events are like entries in a diary - they record facts about what happened.

**Example:**
```
"On January 15th at 2:30 PM, John withdrew $100 from ATM on Main Street"
```

This becomes:
```java
MoneyWithdrawnEvent {
    amount: $100,
    who: "John",
    when: "2025-01-15T14:30:00Z",
    where: "ATM Main Street"
}
```

**Key Rules:**
- ✅ **Past tense** - "MoneyWithdrawn" not "WithdrawMoney" (it already happened!)
- ✅ **Immutable** - Once written, never changed (like history)
- ✅ **Complete** - Contains all information needed

#### 2️⃣ Aggregates - "Business Rules Enforcer"

**Simple Explanation:**
Aggregates are like a security guard - they check if an action is allowed before letting it happen.

**Example:**
```java
// Someone tries to withdraw $1000
account.withdraw($1000);

// Aggregate checks:
// ❌ Is account frozen? → Reject
// ❌ Is balance sufficient? → Reject
// ✅ All good? → Generate "MoneyWithdrawnEvent"
```

**Key Rules:**
- ✅ **No database table** - Lives in memory only!
- ✅ **Validates commands** - Enforces business rules
- ✅ **Generates events** - Records what happened
- ✅ **Rebuilds from events** - Replays history to get current state

**Why no table?**
```
Traditional: Account table stores current balance
Event Sourcing: Events table stores all transactions
              → Aggregate calculates balance from events
```

#### 3️⃣ Read Models - "Fast Query View"

**Simple Explanation:**
Read Models are like a summary page - they show current state for fast lookups.

**Example:**
```
Events table (source of truth):
  - AccountOpened: $1000
  - MoneyDeposited: $500
  - MoneyWithdrawn: $200

Read Model table (for fast queries):
  - Account ID: acc-123
  - Current Balance: $1300
  - Last Transaction: 2025-01-15
```

**Key Rules:**
- ✅ **Has database table** - Traditional table for queries
- ✅ **Denormalized** - Optimized for reading, not writing
- ✅ **Eventually consistent** - Updated by projections
- ✅ **Disposable** - Can be rebuilt from events

#### 4️⃣ Projections - "Event Listener"

**Simple Explanation:**
Projections listen to events and update read models - like a secretary updating a summary.

**Example:**
```
Event happens: MoneyDepositedEvent($500)
                      ↓
Projection listens: "Oh, money was deposited!"
                      ↓
Updates read model: balance = balance + $500
```

### 🗄️ The Golden Rule: What Gets a Database Table?

**This is the most important concept to understand!**

| Component | Has Table? | Why? | Analogy |
|-----------|------------|------|---------|
| **Events** | ✅ YES | Source of truth - permanent record | Bank statement (every transaction) |
| **Snapshots** | ✅ YES | Performance - cached state | Bookmark in a book |
| **Read Models** | ✅ YES | Fast queries - current state | Summary page |
| **Aggregates** | ❌ **NO** | Business logic - temporary | Calculator (does math, doesn't store) |

**Common Mistake:**
```java
// ❌ WRONG: Creating a table for the aggregate
@Table("account_ledger")  // ← This defeats event sourcing!
public class AccountLedger extends AggregateRoot {
    private BigDecimal balance;  // Stored in table? NO!
}

// ✅ CORRECT: Aggregate has NO table
public class AccountLedger extends AggregateRoot {
    private BigDecimal balance;  // Calculated from events!
    // This lives in memory only
    // Rebuilt from events each time
}

// ✅ CORRECT: Read model HAS a table
@Table("account_ledger_read_model")  // ← For fast queries
public class AccountLedgerReadModel {
    private BigDecimal balance;  // Stored in table for fast access
}
```

**Why this matters:**
```
If you create a table for your aggregate, you're doing traditional CRUD, not event sourcing!

Event Sourcing:
  Events table → Aggregate (in memory) → Read Model table

Traditional CRUD:
  Account table ← Direct updates
```

```

### Why Do We Need Each Component?

#### 1. **Domain Events** (e.g., `MoneyDepositedEvent`)
- **What**: Immutable records of things that happened
- **Why**: The source of truth - complete audit trail
- **Storage**: ✅ `events` table
- **Example**: `MoneyDepositedEvent{amount: 100, source: "ATM", depositedBy: "user-123"}`

#### 2. **Aggregate Root** (`AccountLedger`)
- **What**: Business logic that enforces rules and generates events
- **Why**: Ensures business rules are never violated (e.g., no withdrawals from frozen accounts)
- **Storage**: ❌ **NO TABLE** - Lives in memory only!
- **Example**: `account.withdraw(100)` → validates balance → generates `MoneyWithdrawnEvent`

#### 3. **Event Store** (PostgreSQL `events` table)
- **What**: Append-only log of all events
- **Why**: Permanent, immutable record of everything that happened
- **Storage**: ✅ `events` table
- **Example**: Stores events in order with metadata (timestamp, user, correlation ID)

#### 4. **Snapshots** (`AccountLedgerSnapshot`)
- **What**: Cached state at a specific version
- **Why**: Performance - avoid replaying millions of events
- **Storage**: ✅ `snapshots` table
- **Example**: Instead of replaying 1M events, load snapshot at version 999,000 + replay 1,000 events (100x faster!)

#### 5. **Service Layer** (`AccountLedgerService`)
- **What**: Orchestrates loading aggregates, executing commands, saving events
- **Why**: Handles infrastructure concerns (transactions, retries, logging)
- **Storage**: ❌ No table - Pure business logic
- **Example**: `service.deposit(accountId, 100)` → loads aggregate → executes → saves

#### 6. **Read Model** (`AccountLedgerReadModel`)
- **What**: Denormalized view optimized for queries
- **Why**: Fast queries without replaying events
- **Storage**: ✅ `account_ledger_read_model` table (traditional table!)
- **Example**: `SELECT * FROM account_ledger_read_model WHERE balance > 10000` (instant!)
- **Important**: This is a **traditional table** that gets updated by projections

#### 7. **Projection Service** (`AccountLedgerProjectionService`)
- **What**: Keeps read model in sync with events
- **Why**: Maintains eventual consistency between write and read sides
- **Storage**: ❌ No table - Event handler logic
- **Example**: Listens to `MoneyDepositedEvent` → updates balance in read model table

#### 8. **Repository** (`AccountLedgerRepository`)
- **What**: Data access layer for read model
- **Why**: Clean abstraction for querying the read model table
- **Storage**: ❌ No table - Queries the `account_ledger_read_model` table
- **Example**: `repository.findByCustomerId(customerId)` - fast, indexed queries

### The Flow

**WRITE (Command):**
```
Deposit $100 → Service → Aggregate validates → MoneyDepositedEvent → EventStore
```

**READ (Query):**
```
Get balance → Repository → ReadModel table → Return instantly (no event replay!)
```

**PROJECTION (Sync):**
```
MoneyDepositedEvent → ProjectionService → Update ReadModel balance
```

### Why This Separation?

**Traditional Approach:**
```sql
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 'acc-123';
SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE id = 'acc-123';
-- ❌ Lost: Who deposited? When? Why? From where?
-- ❌ Can't answer: "What was the balance yesterday?"
```

**Event Sourcing with Read Models:**
```java
// WRITE: Complete audit trail
MoneyDepositedEvent{amount: 100, source: "ATM", depositedBy: "user-123", timestamp: "..."}

// READ: Fast queries from read model
SELECT balance FROM account_ledger_read_model WHERE id = 'acc-123';  -- Instant!

// TIME TRAVEL: Replay events to any point in time
getBalanceAt("2025-10-17T15:30:00Z")  -- What was the balance yesterday at 3:30 PM?
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Complete Audit Trail**: Every transaction recorded forever
- ✅ **Time Travel**: Reconstruct state at any point in time
- ✅ **Fast Queries**: Read model optimized for queries
- ✅ **Scalability**: Scale reads and writes independently
- ✅ **Business Intelligence**: Analyze transaction patterns
- ✅ **Regulatory Compliance**: SOX, PCI-DSS, GDPR requirements met

## Complete Example: Account Ledger

### 📚 Learning Approach

We'll build a **complete banking account system** step by step. Each step builds on the previous one.

**What we're building:**
A bank account that can:
- ✅ Open new accounts with initial deposit
- ✅ Deposit money
- ✅ Withdraw money (with overdraft protection)
- ✅ Track complete transaction history
- ✅ Query current balance instantly
- ✅ Time travel to see balance at any point in time

**The Journey:**
```
Step 1: Define Events (What can happen?)
   ↓
Step 2: Create Aggregate (What are the rules?)
   ↓
Step 3: Build Service (How do we orchestrate?)
   ↓
Step 4: Add Read Model (How do we query fast?)
   ↓
Step 5: Create Projection (How do we stay in sync?)
   ↓
Step 6: Use It! (Put it all together)
```

---

### Step 1: Define Domain Events

**🎯 Goal:** Define what can happen to a bank account.

**💡 Think of events as:**
- Entries in a ledger
- Facts that cannot be changed
- Answers to "What happened?"

**📝 Events we need:**
1. **AccountOpened** - A new account was created
2. **MoneyDeposited** - Money was added to the account
3. **MoneyWithdrawn** - Money was taken from the account

**🔑 Key Principles:**
- Use **past tense** (AccountOpened, not OpenAccount)
- Include **all relevant data** (who, what, when, where, why)
- Extend **AbstractDomainEvent** (provides common fields)
- Use **@DomainEvent** annotation (for type identification)

```java
// Event 1: Account was opened
@DomainEvent("account.opened")  // ← Unique identifier for this event type
@SuperBuilder                    // ← Lombok: generates builder pattern
@Getter                          // ← Lombok: generates getters
@NoArgsConstructor              // ← Required for deserialization
@AllArgsConstructor             // ← Required for builder
public class AccountOpenedEvent extends AbstractDomainEvent {
    private String accountNumber;      // e.g., "ACC-2025-001"
    private String accountType;        // e.g., "CHECKING", "SAVINGS"
    private UUID customerId;           // Who owns this account
    private BigDecimal initialDeposit; // Starting balance
    private String currency;           // e.g., "USD", "EUR"
}

// Event 2: Money was deposited
@DomainEvent("money.deposited")
@SuperBuilder
@Getter
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
public class MoneyDepositedEvent extends AbstractDomainEvent {
    private BigDecimal amount;         // How much was deposited
    private String source;             // "Wire Transfer", "Cash Deposit", "Check"
    private String reference;          // External reference number
    private String depositedBy;        // User ID who made the deposit
}

// Event 3: Money was withdrawn
@DomainEvent("money.withdrawn")
@SuperBuilder
@Getter
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
public class MoneyWithdrawnEvent extends AbstractDomainEvent {
    private BigDecimal amount;         // How much was withdrawn
    private String destination;        // "ATM", "Wire Transfer", "Check"
    private String reference;          // External reference number
    private String withdrawnBy;        // User ID who made the withdrawal
}
```

**💡 What you get from AbstractDomainEvent:**
```java
// These fields are automatically included in every event:
- UUID aggregateId;        // Which account this event belongs to
- Instant eventTimestamp;  // When this event happened
- String userId;           // Who triggered this event
- String correlationId;    // For tracing across services
- Map<String, Object> metadata; // Additional context
```

**📊 How events are stored:**
```json
{
  "eventId": "evt-123",
  "eventType": "money.deposited",
  "aggregateId": "acc-456",
  "eventData": {
    "amount": 500.00,
    "source": "Wire Transfer",
    "reference": "REF-789",
    "depositedBy": "user-123"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T14:30:00Z",
  "metadata": {
    "userId": "user-123",
    "correlationId": "corr-abc"
  }
}
```

---

### Step 2: Implement Aggregate Root

**🎯 Goal:** Create the "brain" that enforces business rules and generates events.

**💡 Think of the aggregate as:**
- A security guard checking if actions are allowed
- A state machine that transitions based on events
- A calculator that derives current state from history

**🔑 Key Responsibilities:**
1. **Validate commands** - "Can this action happen?"
2. **Generate events** - "Record what happened"
3. **Apply events** - "Update internal state"
4. **Protect invariants** - "Never allow invalid state"

**⚠️ Critical Rule:**
The aggregate has **NO database table**. It lives in memory and is rebuilt from events each time.

**🔄 The Flow:**
```
Command (deposit $100)
   ↓
Aggregate validates (is account open? is amount positive?)
   ↓
Generate event (MoneyDepositedEvent)
   ↓
Apply event (balance = balance + $100)
   ↓
Event saved to database
```

```java
@Getter
public class AccountLedger extends AggregateRoot {

    // ⚠️ IMPORTANT: These fields are NOT stored in a database table!
    // They are calculated from events each time the aggregate is loaded
    private String accountNumber;
    private String accountType;
    private UUID customerId;
    private BigDecimal balance;        // ← Calculated from all deposit/withdrawal events
    private String currency;
    private boolean frozen;
    private boolean closed;

    // Constructor 1: For LOADING existing accounts from event history
    // Used when: Fetching an existing account to perform operations
    public AccountLedger(UUID id) {
        super(id, "AccountLedger");
        this.balance = BigDecimal.ZERO;
        // After this, loadFromHistory() will be called to replay events
    }

    // Constructor 2: For CREATING new accounts
    // Used when: Opening a brand new account
    public AccountLedger(UUID id, String accountNumber, String accountType,
                        UUID customerId, BigDecimal initialDeposit, String currency) {
        super(id, "AccountLedger");

        // Step 1: Validate business rules (guard clauses)
        if (initialDeposit.compareTo(BigDecimal.ZERO) < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Initial deposit cannot be negative");
        }

        // Step 2: Generate event (record what happened)
        applyChange(AccountOpenedEvent.builder()
                .aggregateId(id)

**💡 Understanding the Flow:**

**Creating a new account:**
```
1. new AccountLedger(id, "ACC-001", "CHECKING", customerId, $1000, "USD")
2. Constructor validates: initialDeposit >= 0 ✅
3. Constructor calls: applyChange(AccountOpenedEvent)
4. applyChange() calls: on(AccountOpenedEvent)
5. on() sets: balance = $1000
6. Event is added to uncommitted events list
7. Service saves events to database
```

**Depositing money:**
```
1. account.deposit($500, "Wire", "REF-123", "user-456")
2. deposit() validates: not closed ✅, amount > 0 ✅
3. deposit() calls: applyChange(MoneyDepositedEvent)
4. applyChange() calls: on(MoneyDepositedEvent)
5. on() updates: balance = $1000 + $500 = $1500
6. Event is added to uncommitted events list
7. Service saves events to database
```

**Loading an existing account:**
```
1. new AccountLedger(id)  // Empty aggregate
2. loadFromHistory([AccountOpenedEvent, MoneyDepositedEvent, MoneyWithdrawnEvent])
3. For each event:
   - on(AccountOpenedEvent) → balance = $1000
   - on(MoneyDepositedEvent) → balance = $1500
   - on(MoneyWithdrawnEvent) → balance = $1300
4. Final state: balance = $1300 (calculated from events!)
```

**🎯 Key Takeaway:**
The aggregate's state is **always derived from events**. There's no separate table storing the balance. The balance is calculated by replaying all events!

### Step 3: Create Service Layer

**🎯 Goal:** Orchestrate the complete flow from loading aggregates to saving events.

**💡 Think of the service as:**
- The conductor of an orchestra - coordinates all the pieces
- The glue between your API and your domain logic
- The transaction boundary - ensures all-or-nothing persistence

**🔑 Key Responsibilities:**
1. **Load aggregates** from event store (with snapshot optimization)
2. **Execute commands** on aggregates (business logic)
3. **Save events** atomically (all or nothing)
4. **Publish events** to message brokers (for other services)
5. **Handle concurrency** conflicts (retry logic)

**✨ The Magic Annotation:**
`@EventSourcingTransactional` does all the heavy lifting:
- Saves uncommitted events to the database
- Publishes events to Kafka/RabbitMQ
- Handles optimistic locking conflicts
- Ensures atomic operations (all succeed or all fail)

```java
@Service
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class AccountLedgerService {

    private final EventStore eventStore;
    private final SnapshotStore snapshotStore;

    // Open new account
    @EventSourcingTransactional
    public Mono<AccountLedger> openAccount(String accountNumber, String accountType,
                                          UUID customerId, BigDecimal initialDeposit,
                                          String currency) {
        UUID accountId = UUID.randomUUID();

        return Mono.fromCallable(() -> new AccountLedger(
                    accountId, accountNumber, accountType, customerId, initialDeposit, currency
                ))
                .flatMap(account -> eventStore.appendEvents(
                        accountId,
                        "AccountLedger",
                        account.getUncommittedEvents(),
                        0L
                    )
                    .doOnSuccess(stream -> account.markEventsAsCommitted())
                    .thenReturn(account)
                );
    }

    // Deposit money
    @EventSourcingTransactional(retryOnConcurrencyConflict = true, maxRetries = 3)
    public Mono<AccountLedger> deposit(UUID accountId, BigDecimal amount,
                                      String description, String reference, String userId) {
        return loadAccount(accountId)
                .doOnNext(account -> account.deposit(amount, description, reference, userId))
                .flatMap(this::saveAccount);
    }

    // Withdraw money
    @EventSourcingTransactional(retryOnConcurrencyConflict = true, maxRetries = 3)
    public Mono<AccountLedger> withdraw(UUID accountId, BigDecimal amount,
                                       String description, String reference, String userId) {
        return loadAccount(accountId)
                .doOnNext(account -> account.withdraw(amount, description, reference, userId))
                .flatMap(this::saveAccount);
    }

    // Load aggregate (with snapshot optimization)
    private Mono<AccountLedger> loadAccount(UUID accountId) {
        return snapshotStore.loadLatestSnapshot(accountId, "AccountLedger")
                .cast(AccountLedgerSnapshot.class)
                .flatMap(snapshot -> loadAccountFromSnapshot(accountId, snapshot))
                .switchIfEmpty(loadAccountFromEvents(accountId));
    }

    private Mono<AccountLedger> loadAccountFromSnapshot(UUID accountId, AccountLedgerSnapshot snapshot) {
        return eventStore.loadEventStream(accountId, "AccountLedger", snapshot.getVersion())
                .map(stream -> {
                    AccountLedger account = AccountLedger.fromSnapshot(snapshot);
                    account.loadFromHistory(stream.getEvents());
                    return account;
                });
    }

    private Mono<AccountLedger> loadAccountFromEvents(UUID accountId) {
        return eventStore.loadEventStream(accountId, "AccountLedger")
                .map(stream -> {
                    AccountLedger account = new AccountLedger(accountId);
                    account.loadFromHistory(stream.getEvents());
                    return account;
                });
    }

    private Mono<AccountLedger> saveAccount(AccountLedger account) {
        return eventStore.appendEvents(
                    account.getId(),
                    "AccountLedger",
                    account.getUncommittedEvents(),
                    account.getCurrentVersion() - account.getUncommittedEventCount()
                )
                .doOnSuccess(stream -> account.markEventsAsCommitted())
                .thenReturn(account);
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Create Read Model for Fast Queries

**🎯 Goal:** Create a fast, queryable view of the current state.

**💡 The Problem:**
```
User asks: "Show me all accounts with balance > $10,000"

Without Read Model:
1. Load ALL accounts from event store
2. Replay ALL events for EACH account
3. Calculate balance for EACH account
4. Filter accounts with balance > $10,000
⏱️ Time: Could take minutes for thousands of accounts!

With Read Model:
1. SELECT * FROM account_ledger_read_model WHERE balance > 10000
⏱️ Time: Milliseconds!
```

**🔑 Key Principles:**
- ✅ **Has a database table** (unlike aggregates!)
- ✅ **Denormalized** - Optimized for reading, not writing
- ✅ **Eventually consistent** - Updated by projections (slight delay is OK)
- ✅ **Disposable** - Can be deleted and rebuilt from events
- ✅ **Query-optimized** - Indexes, joins, whatever you need

**📊 Comparison:**

| Aspect | Aggregate | Read Model |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Has Table?** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Purpose** | Business logic | Fast queries |
| **Consistency** | Strongly consistent | Eventually consistent |
| **Optimized for** | Writing | Reading |
| **Can be deleted?** | ❌ No (source of truth) | ✅ Yes (can rebuild) |

```java
@Data
@Builder
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Table("account_ledger_read_model")
public class AccountLedgerReadModel {
    @Id
    private UUID accountId;
    private String accountNumber;
    private String accountType;
    private UUID customerId;
    private BigDecimal balance;
    private String currency;
    private boolean frozen;
    private boolean closed;
    private Instant openedAt;
    private Instant lastTransactionAt;
}

@Repository
public interface AccountLedgerRepository extends R2dbcRepository<AccountLedgerReadModel, UUID> {
    Mono<AccountLedgerReadModel> findByAccountNumber(String accountNumber);
    Flux<AccountLedgerReadModel> findByCustomerId(UUID customerId);

    @Query("SELECT * FROM account_ledger_read_model WHERE balance > :minBalance")
    Flux<AccountLedgerReadModel> findByBalanceGreaterThan(BigDecimal minBalance);
}
```

### Step 5: Create Projection to Keep Read Model in Sync

**🎯 Goal:** Listen to events and update the read model automatically.

**💡 Think of projections as:**
- A secretary updating a summary document
- A mirror reflecting changes from the event store
- A background worker keeping views up-to-date

**🔄 The Flow:**
```
1. User deposits $500
2. Service saves MoneyDepositedEvent to events table
3. Event is published to message broker
4. Projection listens and receives the event
5. Projection updates read model: balance = balance + $500
6. Read model is now up-to-date!
```

**🔑 Key Principles:**
- ✅ **Event-driven** - Reacts to events, doesn't poll
- ✅ **Idempotent** - Can process same event multiple times safely
- ✅ **Eventually consistent** - Small delay between write and read is OK
- ✅ **Rebuildable** - Can delete read model and rebuild from all events

**⏱️ Eventual Consistency Explained:**
```
Time: 10:00:00.000 - User deposits $500
Time: 10:00:00.001 - Event saved to database
Time: 10:00:00.002 - Event published to Kafka
Time: 10:00:00.005 - Projection receives event
Time: 10:00:00.006 - Read model updated

Gap: 6 milliseconds of "eventual consistency"
For most applications, this is perfectly acceptable!
```

```java
@Service
public class AccountLedgerProjectionService extends ProjectionService<AccountLedgerReadModel> {

    private final AccountLedgerRepository repository;

    @Override
    protected Mono<Void> handleEvent(EventEnvelope envelope) {
        Event event = envelope.getEvent();

        if (event instanceof AccountOpenedEvent e) {
            AccountLedgerReadModel readModel = AccountLedgerReadModel.builder()
                .accountId(e.getAggregateId())
                .accountNumber(e.getAccountNumber())
                .accountType(e.getAccountType())
                .customerId(e.getCustomerId())
                .balance(e.getInitialDeposit())
                .currency(e.getCurrency())
                .frozen(false)
                .closed(false)
                .openedAt(e.getEventTimestamp())
                .lastTransactionAt(e.getEventTimestamp())
                .build();
            return repository.save(readModel).then();

        } else if (event instanceof MoneyDepositedEvent e) {
            return repository.findById(e.getAggregateId())
                .flatMap(readModel -> {
                    readModel.setBalance(readModel.getBalance().add(e.getAmount()));
                    readModel.setLastTransactionAt(e.getEventTimestamp());
                    return repository.save(readModel);
                })
                .then();

        } else if (event instanceof MoneyWithdrawnEvent e) {
            return repository.findById(e.getAggregateId())
                .flatMap(readModel -> {
                    readModel.setBalance(readModel.getBalance().subtract(e.getAmount()));
                    readModel.setLastTransactionAt(e.getEventTimestamp());
                    return repository.save(readModel);
                })
                .then();
        }

        return Mono.empty();
    }
}
```

### Step 6: Use It in Your Application

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/accounts")
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class AccountController {

    private final AccountLedgerService service;
    private final AccountLedgerRepository repository;

    // WRITE: Open account
    @PostMapping
    public Mono<AccountLedger> openAccount(@RequestBody OpenAccountRequest request) {
        return service.openAccount(
            request.getAccountNumber(),
            request.getAccountType(),
            request.getCustomerId(),
            request.getInitialDeposit(),
            request.getCurrency()
        );
    }

    // WRITE: Deposit money
    @PostMapping("/{accountId}/deposit")
    public Mono<AccountLedger> deposit(
            @PathVariable UUID accountId,
            @RequestBody DepositRequest request) {
        return service.deposit(
            accountId,
            request.getAmount(),
            request.getDescription(),
            request.getReference(),
            request.getUserId()
        );
    }

    // WRITE: Withdraw money
    @PostMapping("/{accountId}/withdraw")
    public Mono<AccountLedger> withdraw(
            @PathVariable UUID accountId,
            @RequestBody WithdrawRequest request) {
        return service.withdraw(
            accountId,
            request.getAmount(),
            request.getDescription(),
            request.getReference(),
            request.getUserId()
        );
    }

    // READ: Get account (uses read model - FAST!)
    @GetMapping("/{accountId}")
    public Mono<AccountLedgerReadModel> getAccount(@PathVariable UUID accountId) {
        return repository.findById(accountId);
    }

    // READ: Get customer accounts (uses read model - FAST!)
    @GetMapping("/customer/{customerId}")
    public Flux<AccountLedgerReadModel> getCustomerAccounts(@PathVariable UUID customerId) {
        return repository.findByCustomerId(customerId);
    }

    // READ: High balance accounts (uses read model - FAST!)
    @GetMapping("/high-balance")
    public Flux<AccountLedgerReadModel> getHighBalanceAccounts(
            @RequestParam(defaultValue = "10000") BigDecimal minBalance) {
        return repository.findByBalanceGreaterThan(minBalance);
    }

    // TIME TRAVEL: Get account state at specific point in time
    @GetMapping("/{accountId}/at/{timestamp}")
    public Mono<AccountLedger> getAccountAtTime(
            @PathVariable UUID accountId,
            @PathVariable Instant timestamp) {
        return service.getAccountAtTime(accountId, timestamp);
    }
}
```

### 🎉 What You Get

Congratulations! You now have a complete event-sourced banking system. Here's what you've built:

#### ✅ Complete Audit Trail
```sql
-- Every transaction is recorded forever
SELECT * FROM events WHERE aggregate_id = 'acc-123' ORDER BY aggregate_version;

Result:
1. AccountOpenedEvent - $1,000 initial deposit
2. MoneyDepositedEvent - $500 wire transfer
3. MoneyWithdrawnEvent - $200 ATM withdrawal
Current balance: $1,300 (calculated from events)
```

#### ✅ Business Rules Enforced
```java
// Try to overdraw
account.withdraw($10,000);  // Balance is only $1,300

Result: InsufficientFundsException ❌
The aggregate protects your business rules!
```

#### ✅ Fast Queries
```java
// Find all high-balance accounts
repository.findByBalanceGreaterThan($10,000);

Result: Milliseconds! (uses indexed read model table)
```

#### ✅ Time Travel
```java
// What was the balance on January 15th?
service.getAccountAtTime(accountId, "2025-01-15T23:59:59Z");

Result: Replays events up to that timestamp
This is impossible with traditional databases!
```

#### ✅ Automatic Synchronization
```
Event happens → Projection listens → Read model updates
All automatic, no manual sync code needed!
```

#### ✅ Production-Ready Features
- **ACID Transactions** - @EventSourcingTransactional ensures atomicity
- **Concurrency Control** - Optimistic locking prevents conflicts
- **Performance** - Snapshots optimize loading
- **Scalability** - Reactive, non-blocking operations
- **Observability** - Distributed tracing built-in

### 🧠 Putting It All Together

**The Complete Flow (Deposit $500):**

```
1. User clicks "Deposit $500" in UI
   ↓
2. POST /accounts/{id}/deposit
   ↓
3. AccountLedgerService.deposit()
   ↓
4. Load account from events (or snapshot + recent events)
   ↓
5. AccountLedger.deposit($500)
   - Validates: not closed ✅, amount > 0 ✅
   - Generates: MoneyDepositedEvent
   - Updates state: balance = balance + $500
   ↓
6. @EventSourcingTransactional saves event to database
   ↓
7. Event published to Kafka
   ↓
8. AccountLedgerProjectionService receives event
   ↓
9. Updates read model: balance = balance + $500
   ↓
10. User queries GET /accounts/{id}
    → Returns updated balance instantly from read model!
```

**Database State After Deposit:**

```sql
-- events table (source of truth)
INSERT INTO events (event_type, event_data, ...)
VALUES ('money.deposited', '{"amount": 500, ...}', ...);

-- account_ledger_read_model table (for fast queries)
UPDATE account_ledger_read_model
SET balance = balance + 500
WHERE account_id = 'acc-123';
```

**What's NOT in the database:**
```
❌ No "account_ledger" table for the aggregate
❌ Aggregate lives in memory only
❌ State is always calculated from events
```

## Testing

### Unit Testing Aggregates

```java
@Test
void shouldDepositMoney() {
    // Given
    UUID accountId = UUID.randomUUID();
    AccountLedger account = new AccountLedger(
        accountId, "ACC-001", "CHECKING",
        customerId, BigDecimal.valueOf(1000), "USD"
    );

    // When
    account.deposit(
        BigDecimal.valueOf(500),
        "Wire Transfer",
        "REF-123",
        "user-456"
    );

    // Then
    assertEquals(BigDecimal.valueOf(1500), account.getBalance());
    assertEquals(2, account.getUncommittedEventCount());
}

@Test
void shouldPreventOverdraft() {
    // Given
    AccountLedger account = new AccountLedger(accountId);
    account.loadFromHistory(List.of(
        new AccountOpenedEvent(/* ... */, BigDecimal.valueOf(100))
    ));

    // When/Then
    assertThrows(InsufficientFundsException.class, () ->
        account.withdraw(BigDecimal.valueOf(200), "ATM", "REF-456", "user-123")
    );
}
```

### Integration Testing with Testcontainers

```java
@SpringBootTest
@Testcontainers
class AccountLedgerIntegrationTest {

    @Container
    static PostgreSQLContainer<?> postgres = new PostgreSQLContainer<>("postgres:15")
        .withDatabaseName("eventstore_test");

    @Autowired
    private AccountLedgerService service;

    @Autowired
    private AccountLedgerRepository repository;

    @Test
    void shouldPersistEventsAndUpdateReadModel() {
        // Given
        UUID customerId = UUID.randomUUID();

        // When: Open account
        AccountLedger account = service.openAccount(
            "ACC-001", "CHECKING", customerId,
            BigDecimal.valueOf(1000), "USD"
        ).block();

        // Then: Read model should be updated
        AccountLedgerReadModel readModel = repository
            .findById(account.getId())
            .block();

        assertNotNull(readModel);
        assertEquals(BigDecimal.valueOf(1000), readModel.getBalance());
        assertEquals("ACC-001", readModel.getAccountNumber());
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Event Design
- ✅ Use **past tense names** (`AccountOpened`, not `OpenAccount`)
- ✅ Make events **immutable** (final fields, no setters)
- ✅ Include **all necessary data** (avoid lookups when replaying)
- ✅ Keep events **small and focused** (single responsibility)
- ✅ Use **@DomainEvent** annotation for type identification

### Aggregate Design
- ✅ Keep aggregates **small** (single consistency boundary)
- ✅ **Validate in commands**, **apply in event handlers**
- ✅ Avoid loading **multiple aggregates** in one transaction
- ✅ Use **eventual consistency** between aggregates
- ✅ **No database table** for aggregates (in-memory only)

### Performance
- ✅ Enable **snapshots** for aggregates with many events
- ✅ Configure appropriate **batch sizes** (100-1000 events)
- ✅ Use **read models** for complex queries
- ✅ Monitor **event store performance** (query times, storage)
- ✅ Consider **archiving** old events (after snapshots)

### Error Handling
- ✅ Handle **concurrency conflicts** with retries
- ✅ Use **circuit breakers** for external dependencies
- ✅ Monitor **failed event publishing** (dead letter queue)
- ✅ Implement **idempotent** event handlers
- ✅ Log **correlation IDs** for distributed tracing

### Security
- ✅ Store **user context** in event metadata
- ✅ Implement **authorization** in command handlers
- ✅ **Encrypt sensitive data** in events (PII, PCI)
- ✅ Use **multi-tenancy** for SaaS applications
- ✅ Audit **who, what, when** for compliance
